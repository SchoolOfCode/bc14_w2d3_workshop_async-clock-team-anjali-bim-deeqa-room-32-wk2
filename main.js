// You should use setInterval.
// - The hand should move around the clock every second and should complete a full revolution in 60 seconds.
// - You should adjust the rotation of the hand using the transform property as demonstrated in `main.js`. 
const hand = document.querySelector(".hand");
let degree = 0 //starts on the hour
function incrementHand () {
    degree += 360/60 // everytime the set interval runs every second, the hand position will increment by 6 degrees
    hand.style.transform = `rotate(${degree}deg)`; 
    
}

setInterval(incrementHand, 1000)

//üîç HINT: THis is an example of how to rotate the hand!
//function that increments every second -1000ms
//stop interval 
//create a variable 
//create a function to stop the increment
//add event listener
